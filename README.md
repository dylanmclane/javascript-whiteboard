# javascript-whiteboard
A browser whiteboard that lets the user draw using their cursor, clear the drawing, and export the drawing as a png image.

Currently hosted at: https://javascriptwhiteboard.netlify.app/

Next steps:
- Add option to change drawing color
- Add option to change background color
- Currently, images only download. It would be ideal if there were also an option to save/store a few recent images in the browser and display 3-5 of the most recent on the page in an image gallery. An additonal button can be added to the images saved in gallery for download. Clicking previously saved images should add them to the canvas.
