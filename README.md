# javascript-whiteboard
A browser whiteboard that lets the user draw using their cursor, clear the drawing, and export the drawing as a png image.


Next steps:
- Images should save in browser cache, not locally
-   Currently, images download. It would be ideal if saved images stored in the browser and displayed on the page as a 3-5 image gallery. An additonal button can be added to the images saved in gallery for download.
-   Clicking previously saved images should add them to gallery.
